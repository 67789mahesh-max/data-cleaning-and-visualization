# data-cleaning-and-visualization




This project showcases  Analytics workflow within Power BI.I transformed a "very dirty" dataset into a clean, actionable business intelligence dashboard.

The core of this project lies in the Power Query (M) transformations, where I handled complex data inconsistencies, null values, and structural issues without the need for external tools.
